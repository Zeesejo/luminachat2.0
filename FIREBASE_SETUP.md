# Firebase Configuration Guide for Lumina Chat

## Current Status
Firebase initialization has been temporarily disabled to allow the app to run without configuration. The app is now working with mock services.

## To Re-enable Firebase (when ready):

### 1. Add Firebase Configuration Files
- Download `google-services.json` from your Firebase console
- Place it in `android/app/` directory
- Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `ios/Runner/` for iOS support

### 2. Update main.dart
Change line 19 in `lib/main.dart` from:
```dart
// Initialize Firebase - temporarily disabled until configuration is complete
// await Firebase.initializeApp(
//   options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
// );
```

To:
```dart
// Initialize Firebase
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
```

### 3. Update Dependency Injection
In `lib/core/di/injection.dart`, change line 15:
```dart
const bool useFirebase = false; // Set to true when Firebase is properly configured
```

To:
```dart
const bool useFirebase = true; // Set to true when Firebase is properly configured
```

### 4. Generate Firebase Options
Run the following command to generate the Firebase options file:
```bash
flutterfire configure
```

## What's Currently Working
- ✅ App builds and compiles successfully
- ✅ Core MBTI personality system
- ✅ User interface and navigation
- ✅ Mock authentication and user services
- ✅ All Flutter dependencies resolved

## Mock Services Active
- `MockAuthService` - provides test authentication
- `MockUserService` - provides test user data with MBTI personality types
- Test user: "Test User" with ENTJ personality type

## Next Steps
1. Set up Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Configure authentication providers (Google, Facebook, Email/Password)
3. Set up Firestore database for user data and chat messages
4. Follow the configuration steps above to re-enable Firebase
